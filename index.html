<h1>Welcome to the Gromox project webpage</h1>

<p>Gromox is the central groupware server component of grommunio. It is capable of
serving as a replacement for Microsoft Exchange and compatibles. Connectivity
options include RPC/HTTP (Outlook Anywhere), MAPI/HTTP, IMAP, POP3, an
SMTP-speaking LDA, and a PHP module with a Z-MAPI function subset.</p>

<p>Gromox relies on other components to provide a sensibly complete mail
system, such as Postfix as a mail transfer agent, and grommunio-admin for user
management. A webmail client interface is available with grommunio-web. The
grommunio Appliance ships these essentials and has a ready-to-run installation
of Gromox.</p>

<p>Support is available through grommunio GmbH and its partners. See <a
href="https://grommunio.com/">https://grommunio.com/</a> for details.</p>

<p>The source code repository and technical issue tracker can be found at
